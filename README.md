# `useReducer` Hook

One of the crucial hooks to learn in React is `useReducer` hook.

The `useReducer` hook is used for managing state in React applications, especially when you have state transitions that depend on the previous state, or when you have multiple sub-values in your state that need to be updated together. It's similar to `useState`, but it gives you more control over how state updates are handled.
